### Test environments
* local OS X El Capitan with R 3.2.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* local Windows 10 with R 3.2.3

### R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a first release.

### Reverse dependencies

This is a first release, so there are no reverse dependencies.

### Regarding the earlier remarks:

* BDF (3:27, 8:53) in DESCRIPTION
  BDF is correct, it is an EDF variant

* invalid URL http://www.feschet.fr/?p=11 in the vignette
  The link is obscured (but still there because I need to acknowledge my sources)

Thanks for your reply.
