### Regarding the valuele remarks from Kurt Hornik on Feb 3

With respect possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION
- BDF (3:27, 8:53), BDF is correct, it is an EDF variant
- edfReader (8:18), redundant and removed.

With respect to he following (possibly) invalid URLs:
-  http://www.feschet.fr/?p=11 doesn't exists anymore 
    (this also stated in the text, it is included to acknowledge my sourses.)
-  http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/bdfplus has been corrected (some %20 added), thanks

Others:
- use of the title case for the title field, done.
- removing redundand "The edfReader package" form the DESCRIPTION, done
- explaining EDF and BDF in the description, done

Thanks for your reply.
